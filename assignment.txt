On line 84, when the game prompts you how many players there will be, you can't enter a string or else it will crash. You should specify that only integers are accepted.

On line 89, it then asks "Player number 1?". This doesn't convey that the user is supposed to enter the name of their player character.

Changed:
How many players? --> How many players? Only integers such as 1,2, or 3 are accepted.
Player Number x? --> What is the name of player number x?

It was simple to find these issues. I discovered them while using the program
